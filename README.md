# Subsort
Keep forgetting about your subscriptions? End up paying more money on your services than you expected? 
Subsort will solve both of these problems. Subsort is the ONLY free subscription manager on the market,
meaning you don't have to pay any extra fees to get the premium features. With this application, you can
see all your upcoming payments for your subscriptions, so you won't be surprised anymore by any unexpected
payments from your card. With your subscriptions added, you can also check out your statistics. You can
see how much you spend on subscriptions on a yearly and monthly basis and take action accordingly. If you 
want a quick overview of all your subscriptions, you can just look at the calendar to see all your upcoming 
payments for the next 5 years. Finally, if you don't want to check Subsort everyday to see upcoming payments, 
you can enable notifications and Subsort will automatically email you whenever you have a subscription due.
